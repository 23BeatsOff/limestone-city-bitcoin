# Limestone City Bitcoin 

A community-led initiative dedicated to Bitcoin education and adoption in Kingston, Ontario, and the surrounding area. 

This project provides a high-signal directory of Canadian infrastructure, educational resources, and a guide to understanding Bitcoin through the lens of local economic realities.

## 🏛 Project Mission
Our goal is to help Canadians achieve financial sovereignty by providing:
* **Education**: Simplified, relatable guides.
* **Infrastructure**: A directory of trusted Canadian exchanges and vendors (Pioneers).
* **Community**: Organizing local meetups to connect Bitcoiners in the Limestone City.

## 📁 Repository Structure
To maintain a clean and professional environment, this project follows an organized directory structure:
* `/docs`: The source files for the live website.
    * `/css`: Stylesheets and design tokens.
    * `/js`: Functional scripts (including our real-time Block Height tracker).
    * `/assets`: Logos, images, and community branding.
    * `/resources`: Curated PDFs, whitepapers, and recommended reading.

## 🤝 How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from fellow Bitcoiners! Whether you are a developer, a writer, or a local business owner, you can help by:
